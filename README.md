# HighPerformanceProgramming_With_GraphicCards

Exercises of the laboratory course

The basic aim of the exercises is to convert C++ based CPU code into C++ based GPU code.

Go to /SRC folder. CPP file containts C++ code, and .cl file has the GPU code (same implementation of C++ code, but converted for GPU/parallel execution)

Exercise 1 and 2 are in src folder
